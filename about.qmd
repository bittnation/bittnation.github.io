## ✈️ Travel

Travel has given me some of the most valuable experiences of my life. It’s helped me grow more independent, confident, and adaptable in unfamiliar situations. From spending two months living and studying in Florence, Italy, to solo traveling in South America, each journey has shaped my sense of self and deepened my love for exploring the world. Experiencing new places has also strengthened my appreciation for the planet and the urgency of protecting it. In the coming year, I plan to travel to Moorea, French Polynesia to collect samples and conduct field research for my senior thesis; a trip that will combine my passion for travel with my academic goals.

## 🐾 Pets

Animals have always been an important part of my life. Growing up with pets taught me empathy, patience, and a deep respect for the responsibilities of care. I currently have four dogs, one rescue and three golden retrievers, who bring joy and balance to my life outside of academics. My experiences with animals have also shaped my broader interest in ecology and the connections between humans and the natural world.

## 🌊 Love the Ocean

Growing up in San Diego and moving to Santa Barbara for college has allowed me to stay closely connected to the ocean—a place that has always felt like home. My deep love for the ocean has shaped both my personal identity and academic path. I feel incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to dedicate my career to understanding and protecting marine ecosystems through research, conservation, and advocacy.
