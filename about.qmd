title: "About Me"

Hi! I’m Rachel—a curious explorer, animal lover, and ocean enthusiast. Whether I’m hiking through national parks, hanging with my pets, or diving into marine conservation, I’m always chasing connection: with nature, with people, and with purpose.

## ✈️ Travel

I’ve always believed that traveling is the best way to grow. From the misty redwoods of Northern California to the coral reefs of French Polynesia, I love exploring places that leave me feeling small in the best way possible.

## 🐾 Pets

Life is just better with animals in it. I currently share my home with a goofy golden retriever and a very judgmental cat. I’ve also volunteered with animal rescues—nothing makes me happier than seeing an adopted pet find their forever home.

## 🌊 Love the Ocean

The ocean has always felt like home. I’m passionate about marine life and protecting the planet. Whether I’m tidepooling, snorkeling, or walking the shore, I always feel recharged by salt air and sea spray.
