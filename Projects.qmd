*Exploring sediment properties and carbon sequestration potential in a temperate sea grass meadow.*

This project examined how sediment grain size influences organic carbon storage in a temperate sea grass meadow.Using sediment cores collected via scuba from the San Dieguito Lagoon in Southern California, we tested the hypothesis that finer-grained sediments due to their greater surface area and lower oxygen exposure would retain more organic matter.

We found that,Sediments with higher percentages of mud contained significantly more organic carbon, sites exposed to greater wave energy had coarser sediments and stored less carbon, and that there was a strong inverse relationship between sediment bulk density and organic carbon content.

These results highlight the importance of sediment texture in determining carbon burial potential and offer insights for site selection and sediment management in blue carbon restoration projects.

### Learning to code in R studio:

*Personal Productivity Analysis.*

A beginner-level data visualization project exploring how productivity differs between study locations using personal data. This project combines R code, visual output, and reflection on both the process and personal habits.

I created a boxplot using ggplot2 to visualize differences in my productivity (measured in hours) based on where I studied, at home or in the library. The plot includes jittered data points, custom fill colors, and removed the legend for clarity.The visualization indicates that I tend to be more productive in the library, with a higher median and a tighter distribution of productivity hours compared to home.

Althouh simple, this project taught me how to collect, process, and analyze my own data. All are important skills that I plan to utilize and expand upon during future projects.
