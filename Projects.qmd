### ðŸ“„ `projects/research-paper-summary.qmd` â€” Post With Project/Paper Description

This paper was written for my marine ecology course, where we explored how sediment characteristics in seagrass meadows influence organic carbon storage.

## Project Overview

In this study, I analyzed sediment grain sizes from various seagrass beds across California. The goal was to see whether finer sediments, which are less oxygenated, correlated with greater carbon storage.

## Key Takeaways

-   Sediments with a higher percentage of silt and clay had higher carbon content.
-   Sites with more wave energy had coarser sediments and lower carbon levels.
-   These findings support the hypothesis that sediment texture influences carbon burial potential.

Understanding these patterns is essential for developing blue carbon conservation strategies, especially in coastal habitat restoration efforts.
