*Exploring sediment properties and carbon sequestration potential in a temperate sea grass meadow.*

 This project examined how sediment grain size influences organic carbon storage in a temperate sea grass meadow.Using sediment cores collected via scuba from the San Dieguito Lagoon in Southern California, we tested the hypothesis that finer-grained sediments due to their greater surface area and lower oxygen exposure would retain more organic matter.
    
 We found that,Sediments with higher percentages of mud contained significantly more organic carbon, sites exposed to greater wave energy had coarser sediments and stored less carbon, and that there was a strong inverse relationship between sediment bulk density and organic carbon content.
    
These results highlight the importance of sediment texture in determining carbon burial potential and offer insights for site selection and sediment management in blue carbon restoration projects.
