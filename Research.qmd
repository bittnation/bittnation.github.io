## ðŸŒ¿ Research Interests

Iâ€™m broadly interested in the intersection of ecology, climate change, and environmental justice. My academic background in environmental studies and marine biology has shaped a research focus centered on how coastal ecosystems respond to human-driven environmental change.

### ðŸ”¬ Current Interests

- **Blue Carbon & Coastal Ecosystems**: Investigating how sediment characteristics in seagrass meadows affect carbon burial and storage.
- **Ecosystem Resilience**: Studying how biodiversity loss and disturbance events (e.g., fire, ocean acidification) affect the stability and recovery of ecological communities.
- **Environmental Justice & Conservation**: Understanding how conservation science can be more equitable, inclusive, and community-driven.

### ðŸ“ˆ Methodological Interests

- Field ecology and long-term ecosystem monitoring  
- Data analysis in R (especially ggplot2, dplyr, and Quarto)  
- Integration of scientific research with environmental policy and outreach

### ðŸŒŠ Future Goals

My long-term goal is to pursue a career in marine conservation research that integrates field science with policy impactâ€”especially in the face of climate change. I am particularly interested in contributing to applied research that informs restoration, resilience, and environmental justice strategies for vulnerable coastal systems.
