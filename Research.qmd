Iâ€™m broadly interested in the intersection of ecology, climate change, and environmental justice. My academic background in environmental studies and marine biology has shaped a research focus centered on how coastal ecosystems respond to environmental change.

### Current Interests

-   **Blue Carbon & Coastal Ecosystems**: Investigating how sediment characteristics in seagrass meadows affect carbon burial and storage.
-   **Ecosystem Resilience**: Studying how biodiversity loss and disturbance events affect the stability and recovery of ecological communities.
-   **Environmental Justice & Conservation**: Exploring how conservation efforts can address social and environmental inequalities.

### Methodological Interests

-   Field ecology and long-term ecosystem monitoring\
-   Data analysis in R
-   Integration of scientific research with environmental policy and outreach

### Future Goals

My long term goal is to pursue a career in marine conservation research that integrates field science with policy impact, especially in the face of climate change. I am particularly interested in contributing to applied research that informs restoration, resilience, and environmental justice strategies for vulnerable coastal systems.
