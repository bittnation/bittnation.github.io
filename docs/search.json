    "text": "Hi, my name is Rachel Bittner and I am a third year Environmental studies and EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) major at UCSB. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher in the Gaines Lab studying sea grass characteristics and using Environmental DNA to inform management and restoration of coastal marine ecosystems. In regards to that, I am currently preparing to write a senior thesis expanding upon research questions regrading sea grass sediment characteristics. I am passionate about conservation science and interdisciplinary approaches that connect ecological research with social and environmental justice."

From spending two months living and studying in Florence, Italy, to solo traveling in South America, each journey has shaped my sense of self and deepened my love for exploring the world. Experiencing new places has also strengthened my appreciation for the planet and the urgency of protecting it. In the coming year, I plan to travel to Moorea, French Polynesia to collect samples and conduct field research for my senior thesis; a trip that will combine my passion for travel with my academic goals.\n\n\n\nStudying Abroad In Florence"

I currently have four dogs, one rescue and three golden retrievers, who bring joy and balance to my life outside of academics. My experiences with animals have also shaped my broader interest in ecology and the connections between humans and the natural world.\n\n\n\nFinny & Rex"

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nSediments with a higher percentage of silt and clay had higher carbon content.\nSites with more wave energy had coarser sediments and lower carbon levels.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that sediment texture influences carbon burial potential.\n\nUnderstanding these patterns is essential for developing blue carbon conservation strategies, especially in coastal habitat restoration efforts."
