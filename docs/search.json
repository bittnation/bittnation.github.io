I currently have four dogs, one rescue and three golden retrievers, who bring joy and balance to my life outside of academics. My experiences with animals have also shaped my broader interest in ecology and the connections between humans and the natural world.\n\n\n\nFinny & Rex"

Below you’ll find my work from academic research and some coding\n\nSeagrass Poster\n\n\n\nSeagrass OrganicCarbon Storage Poster\n\n\nExploring sediment properties and carbon sequestration potential in a temperate sea grass meadow.\nThis project examined how sediment grain size influences organic carbon storage in a temperate sea grass meadow.Using sediment cores collected via scuba from the San Dieguito Lagoon in Southern California, we tested the hypothesis that finer-grained sediments due to their greater surface area and lower oxygen exposure would retain more organic matter.\nWe found that,Sediments with higher percentages of mud contained significantly more organic carbon, sites exposed to greater wave energy had coarser sediments and stored less carbon, and that there was a strong inverse relationship between sediment bulk density and organic carbon content.\nThese results highlight the importance of sediment texture in determining carbon burial potential and offer insights for site selection and sediment management in blue carbon restoration projects.\n\n\nLearning to code in R studio\n\n\n\nWriting code\n\n\n\n\n\ncode output\n\n\nPersonal Productivity Analysis.\nA beginner-level data visualization project exploring how productivity differs between study locations using personal data. This project combines R code, visual output, and reflection on both the process and personal habits.\nI created a boxplot using ggplot2 to visualize differences in my productivity (measured in hours) based on where I studied, at home or in the library. The plot includes jittered data points, custom fill colors, and removed the legend for clarity. The visualization indicates that I tend to be more productive in the library, with a higher median and a tighter distribution of productivity hours compared to home.\nAlthough simple, this project taught me how to collect, process, and analyze my own data. All are important skills that I plan to utilize and expand upon during future projects."

My academic background in environmental studies and marine biology has shaped a research focus centered on how coastal ecosystems respond to environmental change.\n\nCurrent Interests\n\nBlue Carbon & Coastal Ecosystems: Investigating how sediment characteristics in seagrass meadows affect carbon burial and storage.\nEcosystem Resilience: Studying how biodiversity loss and disturbance events affect the stability and recovery of ecological communities.\nEnvironmental Justice & Conservation: Exploring how conservation efforts can address social and environmental inequalities.\n\n\n\nMethodological Interests\n\nField ecology and long-term ecosystem monitoring\n\nData analysis in R\nIntegration of scientific research with environmental policy and outreach\n\n\n\nFuture Goals\nMy long term goal is to pursue a career in marine conservation research that integrates field science with policy impact, especially in the face of climate change. I am particularly interested in contributing to applied research that informs restoration, resilience, and environmental justice strategies for vulnerable coastal systems."

I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher in the Gaines Lab studying sea grass characteristics and using Environmental DNA to inform management and restoration of coastal marine ecosystems. In regards to that, I am currently preparing to write a senior thesis expanding upon research questions regrading sea grass sediment characteristics. I am passionate about conservation science and interdisciplinary approaches that connect ecological research with social and environmental justice."
